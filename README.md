### ArtCoin Network

ArtCoin Network, short for “Artificial Coin Network”, is a decentralized synthetic asset exchange
where users can trade artificially wrapped tokens that represent stocks, index funds, commodities or other cryptocurrencies. The problem of current synthetic exchanges is that they’re built on Ethereum, and suffer from Ethereum’s expensive transaction fee and slow transaction settlement. By building on a highly efficient PoS chain, ArtCoin Network is significantly cheaper and faster, which is even comparable to a centralized broker while still having decentralized benefits. ArtCoin Network also invents a unique, zk-proof based approach to provide asset price, which supersede an external, not so decentralized oracle like Chainlink. To complete the entire stack, a Uniswap-like AMM will also be built for the initial issue of governance token.
The entire project will benefit from and to your Community. It adds value to the Algorand’s DeFi ecosystem by providing a new kind of native decentralized stable coin, a real world use case of the stable coin of artificial asset exchange and a Uniswap-like AMM. It’s a great showcase to indicate feasibility to build complex, expensive logics on POS chain that was impractical on Ethereum. The unique zero knowledge prover of HTTPS responses is a useful building block to POS chain community project to access any external truth out of the blockchain state without an expensive and less-decentralized oracle.
